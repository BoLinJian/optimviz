## demo-opt - Optimization demo for MATLAB

Run the script `demo_opt.m` for a visualization of several MATLAB optimizers at work, which elucidates their strength and weaknesses.

The scripts runs `fminsearch`, `fminunc`, `patternsearch`, multi-level coordinate search (MCS; [link](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/software/mcs/)), simulated annealing, genetic algorithms (`ga`), particle swarm, CMA-ES ([link](https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaesintro.html)) and Bayesian pattern search (work in progress, code not publicly available yet).

To run most of these algorithms you will need MATLAB's [Optimization Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization/) and [Global Optimization Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization/).
